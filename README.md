# ðŸŽƒ Pumpkin Spice Hit List (PSHL)

**Pumpkin Spice Hit List** is a playful, seasonal-themed project built to demonstrate best practices in React form handling using [React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com/). It was created as a teaching tool for students learning to build and validate dynamic forms with clean UX/UI design. Despite the light-hearted concept, the app models production-quality practices around accessibility, layout, and component structure.
